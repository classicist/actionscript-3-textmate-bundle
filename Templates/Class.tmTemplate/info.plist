#  NOTE: The template parser is designed to remove lines which are considered
#  documentation blocks or code banners, and any trailing empty line.
#
#  This gives us the ability to control whether or not documenation and banners
#  are automatically added by the application. Please set the shell variables 
#  TM_ASDOC_GENERATION and TM_AS3_BANNER_GENERATION to any value to have the
#  parser keep the associated part of the document.
